Controls:
'q' - Terminates the program
'a' - Toggles Anti-Aliasing
'x' - Increases number of rays fired at each pixel (increases smoothing and 
	  blending around each pixel)
'X'	- Decreases number of rays fired at each pixel

Extra stuff:
	- Anti-aliasing
	- I rewrote a bunch of the shape drawing functionality so that it utilizes
	  C++'s object-oriented nature.  All shapes are Polygons and other shapes
	  extend from the Polygon class.  
	  
	  
Notes:
	- Anti-aliasing is very slow.  I fire 10 rays at each pixel by default 
	  because it looks best to me.  I've set it to true by default only to 
	  ensure my work isn't missed.
