Controls:
===============================================================================
'w' - rotate the silhouette to create the 3-D model
'e' - toggle for solid / wireframe faces (default: solid)
'r' - toggle for faces / control points (default: faces)
'a' - apply vertical subdivision
'b' - apply horizontal subdivision
'd' - cycle through Gouraud and Phong shading (default: Gouraud)
's' - toggle between at least two different shininess
'z' - switch from 3-D mode to 2-D mode 
'p' - wasn't implemented, but prints out a message about what it would do if it
      were implemented.
'q' - quit program

't' - toggles lines being drawn between control points
'C' - clears all control points, allowing the user to draw a new sketch

Camera-specific controls:
'c' - resets the camera
'=' - zooms the camera out
===============================================================================
It was never specified whether or not to allow vertical and horizontal shading
simultaneously, so I allow it.  

Horizontal subdivision works, but end point calculations are off, so one end of
the model appears tapered.  I consider it a feature, really.

Lighting can cause artifacts.

There is no Phong... shading.
